# Qpdf Tools

Qpdf Tools is an easy-to-use Qt interface for [Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/) and [Stapler](https://github.com/hellerbarde/stapler), which makes it possible for normal users to manage their PDFs.

With Qpdf Tools, you can easily compress, split, merge and even rotate your pdf documents.

## How to install?

If you just want to use the program to manage your PDFs, We have .deb packages available for download in https://github.com/silash35/qpdftools/releases. If you installed Qpdf tools by a .deb package of version equal to or above 1.2 you will receive updates automatically from our APT repository
Perhaps, in the future, snaps packages and a Windows software version (.exe) may be produced.
Build packages and maintain them is a hard thing, so we have a [repository](https://github.com/silash35/qpdftools-packages) only for that task. Please, help us to keep Qpdf Tools available for users, whatever their operating system.

## How to contribute?
As I said, this program is built-in Qt, so you will need a computer with Qt creator installed to be able to run the code. Then just open the project in Qt creator and run. Remembering that as Qpdf Tools is just an interface for Ghostscript and Stapler, it is necessary to have these two packages installed.

This code was designed to run on a Linux computer, so if you want to run on Windows you will need to make some changes to the code. Incidentally, if you make these changes, please share them with us.
