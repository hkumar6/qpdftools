# Qpdf Tools

Qpdf Tools is an easy-to-use Qt interface for [Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/) and [Stapler](https://github.com/hellerbarde/stapler), which makes it possible for normal users to manage their PDFs.
Currently the program is under construction and some features are not working.

## License

Officially the license is the LGPL because this software is built in Qt, so it is mandatory that it is either GPL or LGPL. But I personally believe that intellectual property does not exist. So feel free to do what you want with this code, including modification, sale and redistribution. You don't even have to give credit, but I appreciate that if you do. I give you the guarantee that I will not sue you unless you sue me first.
Unfortunately, the Qt Company is not as good as I am, so maybe [The Qt company] (https://www.qt.io/company) determines some limitations of what you can and cannot do.

## How to contribute?
As I said, this program is built in Qt, so you will need a computer with Qt creator installed to be able to run the code. Then just open the project in Qt creator and run. Remembering that as Qpdf Tools is just an interface for Ghostscript and Stapler, it is necessary to have these two packages installed.

This code was designed to run on a Linux computer, so if you want to run on Windows you will need to make some changes to the code. Incidentally, if you make these changes, please share them with us.

## How to run?

If you just want to use the program to manage your PDFs, soon we will have .deb packages available for download.
Perhaps, in the future, snaps packages and a Windows software version (.exe) may be produced.
